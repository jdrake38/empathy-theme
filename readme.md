# Empathy Theme by Jaewon Drake built on Plate

Empathy Theme is built for the Empathy Bytes VIP team at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA. Its design is simplistic and designed to be easy on the eyes like other news websites.

The theme is built on the Plate theme (https://github.com/joshuaiz/plate) designed by "Joshua Michaels for studio.bio: https://studio.bio/ with help from Jon Iler".
